1. Install sqlite3: gem install sqlite3-ruby
2. Install toodledo: gem install toodledo
3. Run ./resetdb.sh to create databases
4. Create a file called 'syncconfig.rb' with this content:
@@config = {
  :connection => {
    "url" => "http://www.toodledo.com/api.php",
    "user_id" => "[your user id]"
    "password" => "[your password]"
  },
  :mode => "online",
# :mode => "mock",
  :verbose => false
}

This package monkey-patches the Toodledo gem; cf. toodledo_patch.rb

CURRENT LIMITATIONS
If context 'home' exists remotely and '@home' exists locally, tasks using this context will not be created because there is a mismatch.
